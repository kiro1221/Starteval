Racket interpreter 

Evaluate the function, which we will add stuff to as we work on features.
Evaluate arithmetic expressions (had to implement so I can do “if”).
Evaluate relational expressions (had to implement so I can do “if”).
“If” expressions (not done, I think need more tests).

Test cases for each function above. Need to add more to find bugs.
